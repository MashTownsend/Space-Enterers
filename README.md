# Space-Enterers
This is a test project in Godot to learn GDScript and the Godot UI

The game is MEANT to be played with a controller (joysticks for arcade experience), 
but the system can be run with keyboard too.

R - Reload
A - Move Left
D - Move Right
Spacebar - Shoot

Still needed?
1. Life count
2. Improved enemy shooter algorithm
3. Point system
